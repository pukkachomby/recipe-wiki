Want me to also give you a **stir-fry style Vietnamese option** (non-soup) with tamarind?



Southwest-style with pork mince, corn, and tomato works. Without beans, you can bulk with veg and spices. Core profile: smoky, sweet, tangy.

Ingredients:

* 400 g pork mince
* 2 ears corn (kernels) or 1 cup frozen
* 2 large tomatoes, diced (or 1 can)
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 1 small zucchini, diced (optional for body)
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* ½ tsp chili powder (adjust heat)
* ½ tsp oregano
* Salt, black pepper
* Lime juice
* Fresh coriander or parsley

Steps:

* Fry onion and garlic until soft.
* Add pork mince, brown well.
* Stir in spices, cook until fragrant.
* Add tomato, corn, bell pepper, zucchini. Simmer 10–12 min until thickened.
* Taste and adjust salt, chili, lime.
* Garnish with coriander.

Options:

* Add chipotle in adobo for depth
* Top with avocado slices or grated cheese
* Serve with tortillas, rice, or baked potato

Want me to shape this as a **one-pan skillet meal** (heavier, cheesy, layered), or keep it as a light stir-fry style?
