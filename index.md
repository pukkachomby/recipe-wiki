# NOTES
in the new asian recipes, you can experiment with adding 5 spice

# Salsa
## Materials
* 1 can (14.5 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with juice
* 1 small white onion, quartered
* 1-2 jalapeños, stems removed (and seeds, for less heat)
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled
* 1 large handful of fresh cilantro, thick stems removed
* Juice of 1 large lime
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Method
* Pulse the Aromatics First: Add the quartered onion, jalapeños, and garlic cloves to the food processor bowl. Pulse 5-6 times until they are roughly chopped. This prevents them from turning into a paste.
* Add Remaining Ingredients: Add the canned tomatoes (with their juice), cilantro, lime juice, cumin, and a pinch of salt.
* Pulse to Perfection: Pulse the mixture in short, 1-second bursts. Check the consistency after every 3-4 pulses. I usually find that 8-10 pulses are perfect for a slightly chunky, restaurant-style texture. Be careful not to just turn it on and let it run!
* Taste and Adjust: Transfer the salsa to a bowl. Taste it and adjust the seasoning. It might need more salt, another squeeze of lime, or more cilantro. The flavors will meld and improve if you let it sit for at least 30 minutes before serving.
